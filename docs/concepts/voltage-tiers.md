# Voltage Tiers

There are 9 different voltage tiers in EAU.

| Name | Voltage Range | Harm Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Neutral | Not Applicable | Variable |
| TTL Voltage | ~ 5V | None |
| Low Voltage | ~ 12V | None |
| Low Household Voltage | ~120V | Shocks |
| High Household Voltage | ~240V | Dangerous Shocks |
| Industrial Voltage | ~480V | Potentially Lethal Shocks |
| Suburban Grid | ~ 13.2kV | Lethal |
| Distribution Grid | ~ 55.0kV | Lethal |
| High Tension Grid | ~ 125.0kV | Lethal |

## TTL Voltage

TTL Voltage is your signal voltages. You can use it with digital circuits and it can do all sorts of cool computational stuff. Most signal type devices will accept this voltage level and draw trivial amounts of power.

In most EAU devices, 0V is a digital 0, and 5V is a 

## Low Voltage

Generally based around hobbyist electronics voltages, this is a good introductory tier, and has many low voltage components, such as batteries, low power (slow) machines, and basic light bulbs.

## Household Voltage

This is generally enough for things like kitchen appliances and other machines that are not extremely power hungry.

## Industrial Voltage

These are for the things that require quite a bit of power, and they may also be used for transferring power in a small locality

## Suburban and Distribution Grid

These are found on top of standard wooden power poles, and can provide power to an area.

## High Tension Grid

These are the highest voltage, and are used for long-distance transmission.
